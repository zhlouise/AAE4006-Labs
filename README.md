# AAE4006 Project
## Project Overview  
This project develops a **MATLAB/Simulink-based flight control system** for a fixed-wing aircraft, integrating concepts from flight mechanics, control systems, and trajectory planning. Starting with a basic 3D aircraft model, the system progressively incorporates coordinate transformations, force/torque dynamics, control surfaces, trim conditions, autopilot logic, and trajectory following. The final result is a simulated aircraft capable of autonomous waypoint tracking, laying the groundwork for advanced studies in autonomous navigation and parameter optimization.

## Key Features  
- **Lab 1**: 3D aircraft model using MATLAB's `patch` function.  
- **Lab 2**: Coordinate system transformations (body â†” inertial frames).  
- **Lab 3**: Aerodynamic force and torque calculations.  
- **Lab 4**: Control surface deflections (elevator, aileron, rudder, throttle).  
- **Lab 5**: Trim condition computation for steady-state flight.  
- **Lab 6**: Autopilot design for altitude, heading, and airspeed control.  
- **Lab 7**: Trajectory following with waypoint and orbit tracking.
